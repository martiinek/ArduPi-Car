This is a autonomous mapping car powered by Arduino & Raspberry Pi. Arduino communicates with rpi via UART and rpi sends commands like FORWARD, LEFT etc. The arduino reads them and performs the movement according to the command received and also calculates the pwm from the speed measured by the ir encoders connected to the arduino and also sends the distance travelled to the rpi every 100ms. I also use a camera for a simple edge finding algorithm to detect obstacles and ground, then an ultrasonic sensor, the previously mentioned ir encoders on the motors and a compass. All the data is then used to create a simple 2D map (top view) of the searched area, which will in future gradually expand as the car uses some algorithm to find the best path.
